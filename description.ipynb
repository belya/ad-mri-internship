    "Alzheimer's disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, and the most common cause of dementia. It is a condition where neurons within the brain stop functioning, lose connection with other neurons and die. A build-up of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain are associated with the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course of the disease is irreversible and progressive. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of Alzheimer's disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "MRI can detect brain abnormalities associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and can be used to predict which patients with MCI may eventually develop Alzheimer's disease. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, an MRI scan of the brain may be normal. In later stages, MRI may show a decrease in the size of different areas of the brain (mainly affecting the temporal and parietal lobes)."
