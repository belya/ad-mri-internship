The goal of AD subproject is to find out is the given dataset applicable to solve the problem mentioned by research authors, i.e. "to estimate disease progress using features related to subject and to MRI session" 

The task for this week is to check the significance (or insignificance) of interconnection between the features from demographics data and the CDR score. 

Please look at the description.ipynb file. There is a bunch of hypotheses suggested during the first iteration. Let's split our work in the following manner:

- Elanie - demographic data, A-B
- Raza - MRI-based feature, A

(If you are not listed here, then contact me plz)

To achieve proposed goal, you should use statistical tests to show that the result of your investigation is not accidental, i.e. significant. But any additional materials as explanatory models and visualizations are welcome.
