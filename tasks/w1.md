This week I expect you to achieve the understanding of the suggested task. I.e. to do the following:
1. Download the dataset. Make sure that you are able to read dataframe with subject descriptions. If you want to work with images, make sure you can read MRI scans presented in NIfTI format. 
2. What is the target variable in the dataset? What is the meaning of CDR score? 
3. Propose the hypothesis about the subject features that, in your opinion, can be connected with the further progress of AD disease. Explain your suggestions. For example:
"I expect to see different CDR score depending on the normalized whole brain volume (nWBV). Because during the AD progress, the brain volume reduces significantly"
4. Propose the similar hypothesis about possible features that can be extracted from MRI scans. For example: 
"I expect to see higher hippocampus volume for healthy group than for AD patients. Because the hippocampus is a first part of the brain which gets damaged after the onset of AD"

The information about dataset features is situated on a page 6 of the given paper. I recommend you to read about nWBV feature extraction on pages 3 and 5 as well. Please use these suggestions to put your own hypothesis. Also, please do not forget to mention all sources you've used.
